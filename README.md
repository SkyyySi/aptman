# aptman
Pacman-like wrapper script for Apt.

Since this is a simple bash script, the install is pretty straigt forward:
<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/SkyyySi/aptman.git ~/aptman
</pre>
Optionally, you may want to symlink it into a directory in your <code>$PATH</code>. This way, you can update this script
by just cd-ing into the cloned folder and running <code>git pull</code>.
<pre>
# ln -s ~/aptman/aptman /usr/local/bin/aptman
</pre>
